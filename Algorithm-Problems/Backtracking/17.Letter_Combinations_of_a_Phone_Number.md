>Given a string containing digits from 2-9      inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.      
A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the     telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.    
Example:    
Input: "23"   
Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].    
Note:    
Although the above answer is in lexicographical order, your answer could be in any order you want.


digits是数字字符串    
s(digits)是digits所能代表的字母字符串   
s(digits[0...n-1])   
&nbsp; &nbsp;    =letter(digits[0]) + s(digits[1...n-1])   
&nbsp; &nbsp; =letter(digits[0]) + letter(digits[1]) + s(digits[2...n-1])
