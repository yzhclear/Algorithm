>Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.    
According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”     
Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]     
    &nbsp;    _______6______    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;            \     
    ___2__  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        ___8__     
   /  &nbsp;&nbsp;    \ &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;     /      \     
   0      _4    &nbsp;&nbsp;   7   &nbsp;    9     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         /  \    
&nbsp;&nbsp;         3  &nbsp; 5     
Example 1:   
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8    
Output: 6   
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.   
Example 2:         
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4    
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself
             according to the LCA definition.    
Note:    
All of the nodes' values will be unique.
p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.


```
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        assert( p != NULL && q != NULL );

        if( root == NULL )
            return NULL;

        if( p->val < root->val && q->val < root->val)
            return lowestCommonAncestor( root->left, p, q );
        if( p->val > root->val && q->val > root->val)
            return lowestCommonAncestor( root->right, p, q );

        return root;
    }
};

```
